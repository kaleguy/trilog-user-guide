By default, the app follows your system preference. You can also set it manually:

- **Light** — White background, for daytime use
- **Dark** — Dark background, easier on eyes at night
- **System** — Follows your device setting

## Backup

Your data is stored locally on your device. Backup ensures you don't lose it.

### iCloud Backup (iOS)

Enable iCloud backup to automatically sync your data to Apple's cloud. This also syncs between devices signed into the same Apple ID.

### Export Database

Download your entire database as a file. Useful for:
- Manual backups
- Transferring to a new device
- Keeping a personal archive

### Google Sheets Export

Export your data to Google Sheets format for analysis in spreadsheets.

### Backup Reminders

TriLog reminds you if you haven't backed up recently. The app shows when your last backup occurred.

**Recommendation:** Enable iCloud backup if you're on iOS. It's automatic and reliable.

## Data Management

### Clear All Data

Deletes all entries, notes, and settings. Use with caution—this cannot be undone.

### Restore Purchases

If you've purchased Pro on another device, use this to restore your purchase.

## Pro

Access Pro features and subscription management.

See [Pro Features](pro-features.md) for details on what Pro includes.
