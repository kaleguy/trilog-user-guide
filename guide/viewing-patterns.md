# Viewing Patterns

TriLog offers multiple ways to review your data. Each view shows different patterns.

## The Metrics Grid

Swipe right from the main chart to reach the Metrics view. This grid shows daily measurements in rows:

### What You See

Each row is a different metric:
- **Mood** — Colored bar showing your mood
- **Energy** — Numeric energy level
- **Sleep** — Hours of sleep
- **Steps** — Daily step count (if enabled)
- **Calories** — Daily calorie intake (if tracking meals)
- **Custom Trackers** — Any trackers you've created

Each column is a day of the week. You see seven days at once.

### Customizing the Grid

Tap the settings icon to choose which rows appear:

Hide metrics you don't track. Show the ones you care about.

### Viewing Details

Tap any row header to see that metric in more detail—a focused view showing just that measurement over time.

## Charts View

Swipe further right to reach Charts. This view shows how you spend your time.

### Activity Distribution

See how your time divides across activities:
- Hours of sleep
- Hours of work
- Exercise time
- Leisure time
- And so on

The chart updates as you navigate between weeks.

### Chart Modes

Toggle between different visualizations:

**Bar Chart** — Activities as stacked or grouped bars
**Pie Chart** — Activities as pie slices showing proportions

### Time Periods

Switch between:
- **7 days** — One week
- **21 days** — Three weeks

Longer periods show broader patterns; shorter periods show recent detail.

## Entry History

### Mood Entries List

Each entry shows:
- Timestamp
- Mood
- Energy level
- Activity
- Any associated notes

Swipe left on an entry to edit or delete it.

### Day End Entries

"Day End Entries" (from the Menu) shows your daily reflections—journal entries, goals, and wellness ratings.

This is useful for reviewing what you wrote, not just what you logged.

## What Patterns Look Like

After a few weeks of tracking, patterns become visible:

### Energy Rhythms
You might notice your energy consistently dips after lunch, or that weekends have different energy profiles than weekdays.

### Mood Correlations
Exercise might precede better moods. Poor sleep might precede worse ones. Social time might correlate with happiness.

### Activity Balance
The charts reveal how you actually spend time versus how you think you spend it. Many people are surprised by the numbers.

### Cyclical Patterns
Some patterns are weekly (Monday blues, Friday energy). Some are monthly. Some are seasonal. The longer you track, the more cycles become visible.

## Tips for Pattern Recognition

**Look at weeks, not days.** Single days are noisy. Weeks show trends.

**Compare similar periods.** Compare this week to last week. This month to last month.

**Notice surprises.** When something doesn't match your expectations, pay attention.

**Don't force conclusions.** Correlation isn't causation. Notice patterns, but hold conclusions loosely.
