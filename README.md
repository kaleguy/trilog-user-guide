# TriLog

**A visual journal for mood, energy, and daily life.**

TriLog displays your entire week on a single screen: mood, energy, and activities mapped hour by hour on a visual grid. Patterns that would take scrolling to notice elsewhere become obvious at a glance. There are no scores, streaks, or badges—just an honest record that grows more valuable over time.

## What Makes TriLog Different

Most mood trackers show you one day at a time. You tap a rating, maybe write a note, and the day disappears into a list you'll rarely revisit.

TriLog takes a different approach. The main screen shows seven days of your life—168 hours—in a single view. Activities appear as colored blocks. Mood and energy show as small indicators. Weather, moon phases, and other data layer on top.

This density is intentional. When you can see a week at once, patterns become visible that you'd never notice scrolling through individual entries. You might see that your mood dips every Wednesday afternoon, or that exercise consistently precedes better evenings, or that full moons correlate with restless nights.

## The Three Signals

TriLog tracks three complementary signals:

- **Mood**: Your emotional state (Happy, Neutral, Sad, Anxious, Upset)
- **Energy**: Your physical and mental vitality (1-5 scale)
- **Activity**: What you're doing (Sleep, Work, Exercise, Leisure, etc.)

These aren't meant to capture every nuance of human experience. They're broad categories that become meaningful through repetition and accumulation.

## Philosophy

TriLog is built on a few beliefs:

**Patterns matter more than precision.** Whether you rate your energy as 3 or 4 matters less than doing it consistently. Trends emerge from rough data just as well as from perfect data.

**Accumulation creates value.** A single day's entry tells you almost nothing. A week starts to show patterns. A month reveals rhythms. Several months can change how you understand yourself.

**Gaps are fine.** Life happens. You'll miss days, forget to log, lose interest for a while. The data you do collect remains valuable. TriLog doesn't punish inconsistency.

**Observation, not optimization.** TriLog shows you patterns. It doesn't tell you what they mean or what to do about them. You're the expert on your own life.
